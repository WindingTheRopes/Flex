## Reporting a Vulnerability

One of our goals with Flex is to make a secure shell. We gladly accept any vulnerability reports regarding security. Please follow the following steps for information:

To submit a vulnerability report, please send it as an issue labeled security. Describe the vulnerability in detail and if you have any suggestions, present them in the report. We will try to fix the vulnerability as soon as possible. If your request is closed, it is most likely that we are already working on a fix, or we plan to change how that specific feature functions. If closed, we will include information about why your issue was closed.
