# Flex
A shell for Windows written in C#. Our plan is to make a powerful, lightweight shell written where the core features are written almost entirely in C#.
## Documentation
The Flex documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/alacriware/flex/tree/master/Documentation).

##

Alternatively, you can find the Flex documentation directly by going to the Documentation folder in the master branch.

##

Documentation may be incomplete, as it is not the main development priority.

## Security
